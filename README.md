# PopularMovies2

Connects to themoviedb api and retrieves movies shown in a grid recyclerview using GridLayoutManager as the manager for the RecyclerView. 
User can select a movie and see details, trailers and reviews about a movie. The RecyclerView can be sorted by most popular movie by using the overflow menu. User 
can also select a movie and look at related movies and save their favorite movies. These favorite movies can also be deleted.

one https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction Once you've done that go to the Constants in this app and add your key
